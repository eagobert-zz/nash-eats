    <p class="modal-content">Aw, c'mon Rick. That doesn't seem so bad. It's been six hours. Dreams move one... one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So y'know, every day here is like a minute. It's like Inception, Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie. Hmmm, human music. You're growing up fast, Morty. You're going into a great big thorn straight into my ass. </p>
